Week 5 Individual Status Report

Last Weekâ€™s Goals:
Finish code that uses JGit
Update git repo to include java src folders and empty files.


Progress From This Week:
This week, I spent some more time messing with JGit. Frustrated with the time it was taking to perform what I thought would be a simple
task, I looked for other solutions that didn't involve JGit. To my surprise, it turns out that using JGit was vastly overcomplicating
what turned out to be a simple problem. I dove into git pre commit hooks, and looked more into the general git diff command and found
that I could easily on commit output the changes of each file in whatever format I wanted, which then will be passed into our other tools.
This turned out to be a simple problem that I was over complicating, due to lack of knowledge of git commands. I know have a working pre
commit hook that I can edit to output the diffs in whatever format is needed.

Future Plan:
Next Week:
Connect diff output to other tools
Work on other tools to produce a working build
