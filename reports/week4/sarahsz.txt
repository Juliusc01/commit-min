Section 1 - Goals from a week ago:
- Unfortunately, since MOSS runs on a remote server, we may need to look into a different tool to help us find refactors
- Plan how we will store lines of code of interest for use in modules. Currently, one of my teammates is going to be using a test coverage tool that we've researched and when we meet on Tuesday, we will see how accurate this tool is
Eventually, I will be making sure these lines of code are stored in modules.
- Design how each module interacts with each other and with the system as a whole. Since we are looking at different tools currently, our next meeting will be to see how we can integrate these tools together in a way that works with our tool. I believe our entire group will have to collaborate on making sure each of the tools we are testing today can somehow fit together.
- Build abstract algorithms to determine if lines of code are refactors of each other. I am going to dive into more research on refactoring tools today, and let my team know tomorrow. If we cannot find one, we may need to try to create a refactoring algorithm ourselves.

Section 2 - Progress I've Made This Week:
- I made the architecture diagram for our group's architecture assignment as well as helped with updating our project pitch
- Started the slide deck for our presentation and helped fill out the content within the slides for slides 1-6
- Continued to test JPlag, since last week I realized that MOSS runs on a remote server
- Noticed that JPlag may only be useful for simple cases, so our team is now focusing on the cases where our user only refactors by placing code into methods, I will continue to look into how we may handle more complex cases
- We met up with each other last Sunday to discuss how we would continue with the progress of our project and update each other on what we had accomplished

Section 3 - Plans and Goals for the following Week:
- Plan how we will store lines of code of interest for use in modules. Currently, one of my teammates is going to be using a test coverage tool that we've researched and when we meet on Tuesday, we will see how accurate this tool is
Eventually, I will be making sure these lines of code are stored in modules.

Since we are looking at different tools currently, our next meeting will be to see how we can integrate these tools together in a way that works with our tool. I believe our entire group will have to collaborate on making sure each of the tools we are testing today can somehow fit together.
- Look into the output of JPlag and see if it can be used for complex cases of refactoring
