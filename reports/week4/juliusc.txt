Week 4 Individual Status Report

Last Weekâ€™s Goals:
Write code that uses JGit's library to get the diff between commits in a useable format.
Write skeleton code for other parts of our algorithm

Progress From This Week:
For the majority of the week, I looked more into JGit to try and get some working code. Unfortunately, JGit was a little more confusing to
work with than I had hoped. I spent some hours looking through JGit's API and user guide, and wrote some test code to use JGit but
was unable to get it to work so far. I don't imagine it will take me too much longer to get the code to actually run, but I will just have
to spend some more time on it. JGit it seems was primarily meant to be run on the command line, so information about it's actual java methods
and how to use them seems a little bit scattered. Nonetheless, I'm confident that I can get it to work, but more time needs to be invested
into figuring out JGit. The rest of the time this week was spent on working on updating the proposal and the individual assignment.

Future Plan:
Next Week:
Finish code that uses JGit
Update git repo to include java src folders and empty files.
