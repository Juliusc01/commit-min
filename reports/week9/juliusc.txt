Week 9 Individual Status Report

Last Weekâ€™s Goals:
Get our program to run faster (on diff files?)
Get actual initial results


Progress From This Week:
Early in the week, I worked on the presentation slides in preparation for the presentation on Wednesday. I adapted the slides from the
previous presentation, taking out some, changing others, and of course adding new slides (with a demo). I spent Tuesday night getting
the slides to a presentable state, and then practiced for the presentation. I started to work on getting the output of our tool to
work with the approach that we are now taking, which is using hunks instead of files. I have yet to finish that, but it shouldn't be too
much more work to get it outputting nicely with our new approach

Future Plan:
Next Week:
Fix our tools output
Get actual initial results
Tidy up codebase to comply with issues raised by other team
Work on final draft of report
