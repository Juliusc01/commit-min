Week 9 Individual Status Report

Last Week's Goals:
- Modify delta to work with hunks from a diff instead of lines in a file
- Run the evaluation script to get initial results.

Progress From This Week:
This week I worked on getting delta to work on hunks of a diff rather than all
lines in a file that has changed. To do this, first I had to understand how to
split up a diff into hunks. I ended up finding a tool called splitpatch which
splits up a diff into a patch file for each hunk in the diff. I had to modify
this tool a little for it to work for git diff's rather than just diff's. From
this point, I had to modify delta to take in these hunk files and operate with
them. Essentially, I read in all hunk files for the specific file I was running
delta on, and on each iteration instead of trying to remove lines, delta tries
to patch some of the hunk files.

I was able to get delta working with hunks which significantly reduced our runtime!
The basic example provided in our readme takes less than a minute instead of several
minutes previously. I was also able to get our tool to run on a commit from the
defects4j repo in several minutes rather than not terminating after several hours.
I was under the impression that after it terminated, the code to generate our plots
was going to be executed, but that did not happen. I am meeting with the team
later today to figure out what needs to be called to generate the plots.

Future Plan:
- Work with Connor to get evaluation plots generated
- Work with Evan and Sarah to get the refactor tool built in
- Handle edge cases and failure cases for our tool
