Week 9 Status Report


Last Week’s Goals:
* Get delta to work on hunks of the diff instead of lines of the file
* Run evaluation on many projects in defects4j and get results
* Write tests for the delta debugging tool and integration tests for commit-min


Progress From This Week:


This week our goal was to get our tool to run fast enough to work on an actual repository. Our approach to make this happen was to run delta on the hunks of a diff, rather than every line in the file. We were successful in getting this to work and we were able to run on commits within the defects4j repository. Running our tool on the same commit as last week, our change reduced the number of things delta had to consider from 675 to 5. Commit-min was able to terminate within several minutes rather than several hours with no termination.


We refactored the refactor tool based on the feedback from the peer review. Delta is linked to refactor so that it can read the output that is generated by the refactor tool. We are still working on linking refactor to the pre-commit hook.


Although we were able to run our tool on bugs from the defects4j repo, we haven’t found much that was interesting so far, in terms of the commit being a substantial change. Dispite that we were able to take the expected min bug fix commit and compare it to our tool’s with Graphs and Tables. Our initial results were showing 100% accuracy and 100% precision, we hope to find some more interesting and closer to real life commits to test it on, we also hope to get it working for time as well. We changed our plot a bit so that It plots the bug number on the x-axis.


Future Plan:
Next Week:
* Evaluate commit-min on all commits in defects4j
* Clean up issues presented by nl2bash
* Look for other ways to evaluate our project to get interesting results
* Write unit and integration tests for commit-min


Long Term:
* Consider using something other then maven for delta to get a faster running time by only recompiling the files that need to be recompiled.


Agenda:
* Talk about evaluation results and how to evaluate further
* Ask about additional useful features or things we could do
