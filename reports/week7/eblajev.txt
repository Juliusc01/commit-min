Week 7: Report

Last week's goal:

Finished creating the script that executed Jplag. Changed the interface for how other modules communicate with my script.
They need to pass in the path for every file that has been modified. Worked with Julius to make sure his module, that created git status information,
could produce the correct output so it could be passed into my script.

Discussed pros and cons of using Generic as language type in Travis CI as well as if the tests should be python based or if we
should use a library called bats-core and write bash tests. We settled on python tests.

Wrote unit tests for Jplag script and verified they passed on Travis CI.

This week:

Working on evaluation and writing scripts to test commit-min with defects4J

Future Plan:

Automate evaluation scripts
