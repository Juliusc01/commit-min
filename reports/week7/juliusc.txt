Week 7 Individual Status Report

Last Weekâ€™s Goals:
Assess feedback, improve tool and reports
Work on commiting the minimized file


Progress From This Week:
This week, I edited the pre commit script to print out the new diff that would then be committed first, the one that solely fixes the bug.
It shows what the diff was previously, and indicates which lines have now been removed from the commit. I also started to research what 
would need to be done in order to commit the bug fix seperately, then commit the other changes. git stash looks like it will work in that
respect. I also worked on editing the report document, and updating the readme to include a better and more interesting testt.

Future Plan:
Next Week:
Get our program to run automatically on defects4j
