Week 7 Individual Status Report

Last Week’s Goals:
These are my individual goals from last week’s individual and team plan
-Add output to delta script for user to see changes.
-Experiment with using picireny to replace delta

Progress From This Week:
This week I was not particularly productive on our project due to work from other
classes. We did meet as a team and I led a discussion on how we want the output
of our tool to look. We decided it would be nice for the user to see which lines
of code was removed and where the context around where they were removed from.
However, Julius did the implementation of this. I provided him with a map of
the changes with the path and the change, and he created the output for the user.

I did not experiment with picireny this week, instead I asked Connor if he could
look into it. I decided that even though our tool is slow, our priority should
shift towards evaluation. Once we have evaluation figured out, we can go back to
optimizing our tool to make it more usable.

I did set up my environment and download defects4j. This week I will be digging
into the provided projects, look at the different bug fixes, and try running our
tool on different commits. By Thursday we are expected to have initial evaluation
results, so I’ll be helping write the script that executes our tool on multiple
commits.


Future Plan:
Next Week:
-Run commit-min on commits in dejects4j and fix any apparent bugs
-Write script which will run our tool on some given number of commits
