Week 7 Individual Status Report

Last Weekâ€™s Goals:
Get our program to run automatically on defects4j


Progress From This Week:
This tried to get our tool up and running and get some initial results. I worked with the output files of our tool (the diffs) and
modified them, and set it up to be ready to be passed into the script in which we plot the data. I had to keep track of the changes we did,
and compared it to the minimized file, so we could evaluate it. I tested this on many small commits, and it worked as expected.
I re-wrote the read-me and to explain the changed results, and how to run the evaluation script. I worked on the initial results 
part of the report, to clean it up. Since then, we've talked as a group on slack about how best to get our program to run faster, and talked
about running it on diffs instead of whole files.

Future Plan:
Next Week:
Get our program to run faster (on diff files?)
Get actual initial results
