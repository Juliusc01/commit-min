Week 3 Individual Status Report

Last Weekâ€™s Goals:
Not Applicable

Progress From This Week:
This week, our team met on Sunday to talk about different programs to look at that might be useful for our program, and divided them up among us. 
We thought that first, before we reinvented the wheel, to find various other programs this week that could save us large amounts of dev time. 
I picked JGit, a java library implementation of Git version control, to take a look at and determine if we could possibly use it in our program.
A concern of ours was wondering how we could easily take a look at diffs of commits in a format we could use to then try strategies like delta
debugging and others to narrow commits to just bug fixes. JGit looked promising, and so I took a look at it. I found a blog post on JGit
(http://www.codeaffine.com/2016/06/16/jgit-diff/) detailing the way in which to use it to get the diff between commits. This looks to be extremely
useful for our project, allowing us to not have to worry about manually getting and formatting diffs, allowing us to spend more time on other parts
of the project. While this diversion into related programs wasn't what we had planned for the week beforehand, we think that spending an good
amount of time on this would be sure to save lots of time later.

Future Plan:
Next Week:
Write code that uses JGit's library to get the diff between commits in a useable format.
Write skeleton code for other parts of our algorithm
