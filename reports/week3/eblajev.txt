Section 1 - Goals from last Week
  Nothing for this week
Section 2 - Weekly Progress
  Our team began by splitting up the research into logical chunks. Since our project involves a multiple step approach, we split the
  research into 1. Parsing git diffs 2. Refactoring. 3. Delta Debugging/Experimental test removal. I focused on finding more research
  literature regarding refactoring. Several of the papers and tools I found only worked on Java specific style refactoring. These tools
  would automatically make sure code did not have a for loop that spanned multiple lines or that there was a space between a closing parenthesis
  and a opening curly bracket.

  Since we hope to notice more complex refactoring, I will look into the plagiarism detection tool, MOSS later today. A teammate and I have taken CSE 444
  and we will run the MOSS tool on both of our solutions to the CSE 444 labs to test MOSS. Once we establish a baseline, we will then choose sections
  of the code and make them exactly the same and run MOSS again. After this we will introduce simple refactoring to see if MOSS detects these refactorings
  to be logically equivalent.

  We will also look into a library called CheckSims.

Section 3 - Next Week's Goals
  Next week I will work on determining how to best store line diffs and what sort of data structures to use. Since we are combining multiple external
  libraries I will also determine the what types of inputs are needed for each library and work on a way to manipulate the output of one library to be
  and effective input for another library. This is contingent on the team having a consensus on which libraries we would like to use.
