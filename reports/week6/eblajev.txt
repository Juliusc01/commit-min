Week 6 Individual Report

Last week's goals:
Spent time understanding the type of refactor detection that our tool would need.
Decided to move forward on variable renaming, white space and commenting as the three
types of refactors our initial version of the tool would be able to detect. Also worked
on creating a script to automate running JPlag, still in the works, but should be finished later today.

This week's progress:

Finished creating the script that executed Jplag. Changed the interface for how other modules communicate with my script.
They need to pass in the path for every file that has been modified. Worked with Julius to make sure his module, that created git status information,
could produce the correct output so it could be passed into my script.

Discussed pros and cons of using Generic as language type in Travis CI as well as if the tests should be python based or if we
should use a library called bats-core and write bash tests. We settled on python tests.

Wrote unit tests for Jplag script and verified they passed on Travis CI.

Future Plan:

Continue writing tests for Jplag as well as look into performance improvements for Delta since it is running slow.
