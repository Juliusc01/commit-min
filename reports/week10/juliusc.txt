Week 9 Individual Status Report

Last Weekâ€™s Goals:
Fix our tools output
Get actual initial results
Tidy up codebase to comply with issues raised by other team
Work on final draft of report


Progress From This Week:
This week, I worked on our tools output to make sure we got nice and clean results. I made it output
correctly to the dataProcessor tool that conner wrote, and then edited that tool to have each project
we run our tool on (in defects4j) to have its own set of graphs and data. I then ran our tool to get the
initial data, and there are still a few hiccups that we then worked to fix. I worked on the final draft
of the report, helping to get the results into the draft.

Future Plan:
Next Week:
Run tool on all files to get all data
Tidy up Repo
Finish final report
