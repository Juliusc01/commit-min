Last Week:
Tested end to end setup to simulate a new user
Went through readme and found confusing pinch points and made the installation clearer
Set up meeting to understand deltaâ€™s needs how to tie refactor into it
Set ups group meeting on Tuesday in addition to weekly meeting to have group work time
Create regex for delta to only consider hunks corresponding to tests (pair programming with Jacob)

This week:
    Completed integration of refactor into precommit and delta, took a long time to resolve bugs

Next Week:
    plug refactor into multi -delta and prepare presentation for finals week :)
