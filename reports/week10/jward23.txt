Week 10 Individual Status Report

Last Week's Goals:
- Work with Connor to get evaluation plots generated
- Work with Evan and Sarah to get the refactor tool built in
- Handle edge cases and failure cases for our tool

Progress From This Week:
This week I spent my time helping Evan and Sarah with the refactor
module, working with Julius and Connor on the evaluation stuff, and I
cleaned up our repo to address some of the feedback from the code review.

I was able to help Evan and Sarah get our tool installed and working on their
machines which allowed them to continue progress on the refactor tool. I also
ensured they were able to follow the steps to setup our project for evaluation.
This helped us understand weak spots in our documentation that we can fix
before we finish up.

Our repository was quite a mess with many unnecessary files in it, code we
didn't write, and the structure of files was not intuitive. I did my best to
clear this up so it is much more managable for people who will be using our
tool. I didn't have time to work on edge cases, but will do that in the final
week to make sure our final evaluation process goes smoothly.

Future Plan:
- Handle edge cases and failure cases for our tool
- Update README's to ensure our results are able to be replicated
